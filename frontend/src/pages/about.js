            <p>Telmee is an easy to use platform dedicated to bring together the event organizing committees and the interested audience.</p>
            <p>This app is mainly designed for the students and committees of Datta Meghe College of Engineering</p>
            <p>The problem that we are trying to solve here is to make every event accessible to every student. The most simple UI to understand the contents of the event and register for it with least of your efforts.</p>
            <p>Users can also post images about the event that they attended for others to have a more clear understanding of the event.</p>
